## Lab Report 3

Hi again! This is my third lab report, and for this report I was tasked with learning some options a command-line command could be used with. The command I
chose to use for this assignment is the `less` command. `less` is a command that displays a txt file on a window separate from the terminal, allowing a user
to read a file's contents without crowding out their terminal. In this blog I'll be showing you four different command=line options for the command.

First, to get an idea of the output of `less`, I'll show you what is displayed on my terminal when I use the command to read the file `HistoryItaly.txt`. Here
is the input followed by the output:

`less HistoryItaly.txt`
