## Lab Report 3

Hi again! This is my third lab report, and for this report I learned about some options a command-line command could be used with. The command I
chose to use for this assignment is the `less` command. `less` is a command that displays a txt file on the terminal, allowing a user
to read a file's contents without crowding out their terminal. In this blog I'll be showing you four different command=line options for the command.

First, to get an idea of the output of `less`, I'll show you what is displayed on my terminal when I use the command to read the file `HistoryItaly.txt`. Here
is the input followed by the output:

`less HistoryItaly.txt`

**INSERT IMAGE**

As you can see, the contents of the file were displayed in the terminal. I can exit this screen and return to the terminal by pressing q.

# Option 1: -N

This is a command use to display line numbers to the left of the displayed output of a text file. I found this command through an online manual on the less command
, at https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.htm. 

Here is an example of a command to use `less -N` to open the `HistoryItaly.txt` file:

`less -N HistoryItaly.txt`

Output:
